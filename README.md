how to start: in terminal  write: npm install and then npm start

for run both open two terminal - for backend go to Folder Backend and for Frontend go to folder frontend

i have 5 api:
get - "/api/tasks" - for getting the tasks /n
post - "/api/tasks" - for new task
put - "/api/tasks/:id" - for update task
delete - "/api/tasks/:id" - for delete task
patch - "/api/tasks/:id/toggle" - for switching completed value

i didnt finish to do logger in middleware in backend (i wanted to save it to the end but did not have time)

the design was based on the File Structure you gave on the instructions
for backend - 70 min
for front - 150 min
for styling - 20 min
